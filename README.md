Task 2: Predictive Analysis Using Machine Learning
Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Model
Description of What I Did:
For Task 2 of the internship, I created a simple machine learning model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive, based on their age and ticket fare. I used Python and the scikit-learn library to build and train a logistic regression model. This project helped me understand how computers can learn from past data to make predictions.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python (via Anaconda)

Jupyter Notebook

scikit-learn

pandas

Titanic dataset (CSV file)

Steps I Followed:
Installed the required libraries using !pip install pandas scikit-learn.

Loaded the Titanic dataset using pandas.

Cleaned the data by removing empty rows.

Selected 'Age' and 'Fare' as features (X) and 'Survived' as the label (y).

Split the data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).

Trained a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.

Tested the model and measured its accuracy.

Visualized the results using a confusion matrix.

Output:
A confusion matrix was generated to show how well the model performed at predicting survival.
